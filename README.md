# San Francisco Crime Statistics competition

This dataset is for the Kaggle competition on SF crime statistics:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime

The training and test data are not included in the repository but can be found on the Kaggle page or you can grab it here:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/puhlz7wqr5qgy82/AACredmHnUyPyUrNuw5OuKLja?dl=0
You should put it in the data/ directory if you intend to run on it using this software. 

A demo of my results can be viewed directly on github here:
https://github.com/along528/SFCrime/blob/master/code/sfcrime.ipynb

It uses an ipython notebook and should be self explanatory.
